Some things should be clear before start using this "framework".

<b>1st</b> - This is not exactly a framework, this is just a MVC structure with some usefull methods to help you on simple CMS.

<b>2nd</b> - This framework comes with a authentication functionality, and it should be very clear that this is <b>NOT</b> a secure method for 
authentication, it's goal is to simply provide a custom experience for each user and store data.

<b>3rd</b> - The documentation contains all the methods and instructions necessary for you to get the most out of the framework.
